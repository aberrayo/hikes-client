# Hikers Trail Log

This app is a simple tool that allowes hikers to save the details of hikes
they completed. A hikers would have a personal authentication page where thier
saved files can be seen by other people who use the app but protected from any
edit or deleate action.

## Short Comings

At the back end, i would have liked to make the app comprehensively functional
with all the basic neccessitie a hiker needs from a moden app. That would mean
instead of one to many resourse relationship, i would add to it a many to many
dynamic relationship.

Also in the front end, more work can be done. From styling the app better to
adding some javascript functionality to the stored data and giving the user more
feedback.

## Lessons Learned

I have learned several lessons during this project. From understanding how data
is structured and saved at the back end and how it communicates to the front end
and how the whole fullstock application architecture works.
Personally. I have gotten better at ways to approch problems and the efficient
way to go about solving those problems. That includes asking the right
questions and searching online resourses and understanding what i see.
