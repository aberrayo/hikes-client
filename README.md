Short Comings

At the back end, i would have liked to make the app comprehensively functional
with all the basic neccessitie a hiker needs from a moden app. That would mean
instead of one to many resourse relationship, i would add to it a many to many
dynamic relationship.

Also in the front end, more work can be done. From styling the app better to
adding some javascript functionality to the stored data and giving the user more
feedback.
